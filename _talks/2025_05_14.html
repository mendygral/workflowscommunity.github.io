Multi-site workflows rely on science networks for connectivity,
high-performance data transfer, high-performance streaming,
visualization, and related capabilities. This talk will describe
the role of science networks in enabling workflows which span
multiple sites, including interaction with data transfer and
security systems in site networks.
