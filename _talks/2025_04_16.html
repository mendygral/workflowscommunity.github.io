Computational workflows routinely execute tasks faster than a
human scientist can understand and act on their outcomes, which
means decisions about what tasks to run become outdated quickly.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have emerged as a route to
adjust a workflow during operation, potentially increasing its
effectiveness by learning which tasks may prove most informative.
In this talk, we will discuss application patterns that integrate
AI into scientific workflows and introduce software which simplify
building such “AI steered applications.” The topics will include
dissecting a materials design application built around a Generative
AI model and middleware necessary to scale data-intensive AI workflows
past thousands of GPU nodes.
