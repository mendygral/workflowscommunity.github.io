Iâ€™ll discuss the challenges (and opportunities!) of teaching workflow systems to
scientists, and present two concepts that I have found useful for guiding my
teaching: (1) workflow systems as imperfect mirrors of practical computing, and
(2) the Kernighan method for assessing lesson difficulty.

He has been teaching
and training snakemake workflow development for a while and has a draft
(incomplete) book introducing snakemake here:
