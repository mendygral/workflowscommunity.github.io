            Scientific workflows have underpinned some of the most significant discoveries of the past several decades.
            Workflow management systems (WMSs) provide abstraction and automation that enable researchers
            to easily define sophisticated computational processes, and to then execute them efficiently 
            on parallel and distributed computing systems. As workflows have been adopted by multiple scientific communities,
            they are becoming more complex and require more sophisticated workflow management capabilities. A workflow can now
            analyze terabyte-scale data sets; execute millions of individual tasks; coordinate heterogeneous resources
            and tasks from edge to core; and process near real-time data streams, files, and data placed in different types of storage systems.
            The computations can be single core workloads, loosely-coupled tasks, or tightly-coupled computations,
            and can run in heterogeneous distributed computing platforms all within a single workflow.
            </p>

            The Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS) focuses on the many facets of
            scientific workflow composition, management, sustainability, and application to domain sciences in an increasingly
            diverse and a rapidly evolving technology landscape. WORKS aims to serve as the central meeting point for all
            the stakeholders involved in the evolving workflows community, and to showcase the latest developments
            and emerging approaches in the field.

            WORKS25 will be held in conjunction with the International Conference for
            High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC25) 
            at the America’s Center Convention Complex in downtown St. Louis, Missouri (USA).
