            <p>
                Complex workflows have increasingly high computational and I/O demand and are composed of many
                communicating
                orchestrators, services, and simulations. The ECP ecosystem has observed an increasing pervasiveness of
                workflow
                systems to handle these classes of complex, distributed applications. The interplay of workflow
                technologies
                and
                HPC has been challenged by the fast rise of ML technologies: ML needs to be integrated within workflows
                to
                ease
                their development and portability; workflows must benefit from ML to scale and increase efficiency of
                executions; HPC must embrace workflows to democratize access to its resources, as workflow systems
                should
                better
                exploit the power of HPC systems; ML must adapt to HCP architectures to scale to real-world large
                settings,
                and
                HCP must adjust to ML requirements to provide the required computational resources to scale up to
                extremely
                large data sets. Furthermore, HPC resource allocation policies and scheduler designs typically provide a
                simple
                "job" abstraction instead of workflow-aware abstractions. As a result, it is difficult to run exascale
                workflows
                efficiently and conveniently on HPC systems without extending resource management/scheduling approaches.
                In
                this
                BoF, we will bring together researchers and DOE facility representatives from the workflows, HPC, and
                AI/ML
                communities that work on scientific research questions requiring large-scale, distributed, and AI-heavy
                computing at exascale as well as workflows that allow the integration of (physical) experiments and
                computational facilities. The session will discuss challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, and
                will
                seek
                input for a post-ECP community roadmap focused on the sustainability of HPC and AI workflows software
                and
                applications.
            </p>

            <p>Specifically, the BoF session discussions will focus on the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the era of exascale and ML/AI, what are the emerging and future crucial challenges for post-ECP
                    workflows?</li>
                <li>Considering workflows sustainability, what are the key constraints and opportunities to attain
                    sustainability?</li>
                <li>Which software/technology are essential for enabling sustainable workflows post-ECP?</li>

                            these

                        <li>Interactive, human-in-the-loop model evolution/iteration is a must. How that fits into

                        <li>Interconnection of systems; Standardized APIs; Data management</li>
                        <li>One issue is that training data is often generated by physics models. These models take a
                            lot
                            more
                            time
                            and resources than a typical ML model for either training or inference. So there is a
                            “length
                            scale”

                        <li>Funding specific software vs applications vs workflows</li>
                        <li>If we can not have a unified funding stream for sustainability, we should encourage agencies
                            and
                            program

                        <li>Availability of no-code or low-code tools for defining and managing a workflow that lowers

                        <li>The key opportunity is to create a wealth of knowledge and reusable capabilities. With a

                            of workflows, I foresee a path to autonomous AI/ML-driven exploration of scientific
                            questions.
                            One
                            constraint is that we need to think about how sustain workflows at scale, at a
                            population-level.

                        <li>Standardized formats; Portability</li>
                        <li>If workflows are complicated enough then managing the decencies becomes a challenge. You
                            need to
                            test
                            all the interdependencies to ensure that the whole workflow keeps working.</li>
                        <li>Opportunity: define benchmarks around workflows (and hope this benchmark lives like linpack
                            did);
                            Constraint: to some extent a workflow with science is often something that is implemented to
                            something
                            for the first time ( never done before experiment) the tools required for production
                            workflows
                            vs
                            experimental workflows are not the same</li>
